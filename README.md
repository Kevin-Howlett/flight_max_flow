## flight_max_flow Algorithms Project

This repo contains Python code that serves as a solution to a specific maximum-flow problem.

The goal was to take in flight data (taken from https://openflights.org/data.html), a starting city or list of starting airports, and a destination city or list of destination airports, and output the max amount of people that may be flown from start to end without utilizing any flight more than once.

A detailed report can be found in the file report.pdf and the full Python notebook is in flight_max_flow.ipynb.
